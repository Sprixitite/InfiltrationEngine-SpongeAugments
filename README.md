# SpongeZoneTools
Plugin designed to augment the [official InfiltrationEngine tooling](https://github.com/MoonstoneSkies/InfiltrationEngine-Custom-Missions) and any derivative plugins.

Currently consists of two tools (although if I feel like it later updates will add more)  
1) Cell Fixup - One-press button to fix styling of manually produced cell floors/ceilings, as a bonus also consistently styles Links
2) Toggle Group Visibility - Non-destructively toggles the visibility of an entire model/folder, a'la blender's collection visibility

Use at your own risk etc. etc.
